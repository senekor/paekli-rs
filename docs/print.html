                        <h1 id="-paekli-rs-"><a class="header" href="#-paekli-rs-">✨ paekli-rs ✨</a></h1>
<p>This is a guide for an exercise project in Rust.
It is intended as the next thing to do after reading <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language</a>.</p>
<p>The aim of paekli-rs is to bridge the gap between <em>the book</em> and production-ready code, emphasizing among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>library usage</li>
<li>inter-process communication</li>
<li>integration in a polyglot environment</li>
<li>automated testing and delivery (CI/CD)</li>
<li>having lots of fun! 😃</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-topic"><a class="header" href="#the-topic">The Topic</a></h2>
<p>In order to have a little bit of fun, the application will be themed as a simulation of a postal service.
In practice, that's just a messaging application.
This topic was chosen because its feature set is very flexible and can adapt to what and how much <strong>you</strong> want to do.</p>
<p>Our postal service could be sending "packages" around, but that word has another meaning in the software world.
So, we'll be using the less ambiguous term <strong>paekli</strong> to refer to deliverables in our business domain.</p>
<h2 id="choose-your-own-components"><a class="header" href="#choose-your-own-components">Choose your own components</a></h2>
<p>This book is structured around self-contained guides for what we'll call <em>components</em>.
You can choose to implement almost any combination of them in almost any order.
In its simplest form, the application can be a single component, e.g. a CLI app, without any integrations with other components.
If you choose to go the extra mile, the application can grow into a diverse set of interacting clients and servers.</p>
<p>For example, a python script might call into a Rust library that sends a paekli to an http server which live-updates a wasm-based browser app over websocket!
Very cool!</p>
<p>As you can see in the sidebar, the components are loosely categorized into <strong>clients</strong>, <strong>servers</strong> and <strong>storage backends</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients can be stand-alone and may use servers and storage backends.</li>
<li>Servers can be stand-alone, but are probably difficult to use without a client.
They may also use storage backends.</li>
<li>Storage backends can't be stand-alone, as their only purpose is to be used by clients and servers.</li>
</ul>
<div id="admonition-choose-your-own-difficulty" class="admonition admonish-tip" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-choose-your-own-difficulty-title">

<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="introduction.html#admonition-choose-your-own-difficulty"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>The guides are supposed to be at moderate to low difficulty, although there is some variability.
If you'd like a bigger challenge, you are always welcome to go off the beaten path!
Are you a web developer and find the HTTP server guide boring?
Invent a new feature that requires you to use query params and try to make them type-safe.
You get the idea.
The more you go off the beaten path, the more difficult it will be to integrate different components, which might be exactly the challenge you're looking for.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The book assumes that you're using a Unix-like operating system.
Linux is officially supported, but Mac should work just as well.
If you're on Windows, you should be fine by using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">WSL</a>.
However, please do not open issues related to that.</p>
<p>You also need to be familiar with version control, i.e. <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>.
If you aren't, paekli-rs is probably not right for you.
This book assumes you use git, but if you know what you're doing, feel free to use a git-compatible alternative like the excellent <a href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj">jujutsu</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you're ready to get started, <strong>proceed to the <a href="./setup.html">project setup</a></strong>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="project-setup"><a class="header" href="#project-setup">Project Setup</a></h1>
<p>Since the purpose of this project is to be production-ready, we won't take any shortcuts.
The following concepts are central to the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>version control</li>
<li>automatic testing &amp; delivery</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="version-control"><a class="header" href="#version-control">Version Control</a></h2>
<p>For the automation part, we'll be using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a>.
This is unfortunately a proprietary automation platform by GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft.
However, it is provided for free and many developers have experience with it, so it is the most pragmatic choice for now.
I'm keeping my eyes open for more FOSS-friendly alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/new?name=paekli-rs">Create a new repository on GitHub</a>.
It must be called <code>paekli-rs</code>, since some of the automation &amp; tooling relies on that name.
Making it generic would be overly complex and the error messages are bad, so do yourself a favor and stick to the name <code>paekli-rs</code>.
Also, don't add your code for this project to a subdirectory of a different repository where you might be storing other Rust exercises already.
This will cause unnecessary headaches with mismatched paths in scripts.</p>
<p>You also need to create a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html">cargo workspace</a> in your new repo.
We will be adding multiple crates during the project, a workspace makes it easier to manage them.
Some of our project automation also relies on its presence.
Add a file called <code>Cargo.toml</code> at the root of your repository with the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[workspace]
resolver = "2"
members = []

[workspace.package]
repository = "https://github.com/&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;/paekli-rs"
</code></pre>
<p>Fill in your username in the <code>repository</code> url, it's needed for the project automation later.</p>
<h2 id="cicd"><a class="header" href="#cicd">CI/CD</a></h2>
<p>In order to facilitate a "continuous integration" workflow, we need to make sure that coding standards are uphelp and tests pass on the main branch.
GitHub Actions provides this automation.
Create a new automation workflow by adding a file at <code>.github/workflows/test.yml</code> (from the root of your repository).</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Test
on: push

jobs:
  ci:

<p>For the "continuous delivery" part, we need to make sure that any new features we develop can quickly be delivered into the hands of our users.
There is an awesome project called <code>cargo-dist</code>, which can create a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically compiles your program to be downloaded by users whenever you push a new version tag.
That's exactly what we need!</p>
<p>Create a stub for the CLI component so you have an actual Rust package that can be compiled:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo new paekli-cli
</code></pre>
<p>This command should automatically add the new package to your cargo workspace, so the <code>members</code> list in the top-level <code>Cargo.toml</code> should contain the string <code>"paekli-cli"</code>.
It it doesn't, something in your workspace manifest is probably misconfigured.</p>
<p>Change the code in <code>paekli-cli/src/main.rs</code> to the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    panic!("Paekli LLC is currentli closed 😢");
}

#[test]
#[should_panic]
fn paekli_llc_is_closed() {
    main();
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>That's a good enough stub, we even have a test for our continuous integration workflow to run.</p>
<p>Next, install <code>cargo-dist</code> and initialize it.
During initialization, you will be prompted about which platforms you want to build for, which installers to generate and maybe more.
It mostly doesn't matter for the purpose of this project.
Just make sure you enable at least one installer that's applicable to you so you can easily test the results.
<code>shell</code> should be enough.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo install cargo-dist
cargo dist init
</code></pre>

<p>If you're getting that error, there is something wrong with your <code>Cargo.toml</code> files.</p>
<p>First, make sure your top-level <code>Cargo.toml</code> contains the url to your repository
You have to replace your GitHub username in the url!</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[workspace.package]
repository = "https://github.com/&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;/paekli-rs"
</code></pre>
<p>Next, make sure the <code>Cargo.toml</code> in the <code>paekli-cli</code> directory contains a reference to the url in the workspace:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
# ... other keys like name, version, edition ...
repository.workspace = true
</code></pre>
<p>Continue once you can run <code>cargo dist init</code> without errors.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>At this point, you should have a generated file at <code>.github/workflows/release.yml</code>.</p>
<p>To enjoy the fruits of your labor, trigger your first release workflow as such:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Commit and push all your current changes.
git add --all ; git commit ; git push
# Create and push a version tag.
# cargo-dist recognizes this and releases all packages with a matching version.
git tag v0.1.0 ; git push --tags
</code></pre>
<p>When you navigate to your repository on GitHub, you should see the release workflow running under the "Actions" tab.
Once that is complete, go back to the front page of your repo.
There should be a new release in the sidebar on the right.
If you click on that, you should see a list of all compiled binaries ready for download as well as a simple shell command for installation, assuming you enabled that during <code>cargo dist init</code>.</p>

<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>Now that you're ready to do some serious software development, it's time to choose your first component to implement!
Unless you have a strong desire to do something else, I recommend to <strong>start with the <a href="cli.html">CLI</a></strong>.
It is the easiest component to implement and its guide is the most detailed.
The other guides are still self-contained, but they provide fewer explanations of steps that are identical or similar for all components.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cli"><a class="header" href="#cli">CLI</a></h1>
<p>Ready to write a <code>paekli-cli</code>?
Here's what the final product might look like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; paekli-cli send carrots --to lisa
Thank you for trusting Paekli LLC!
We will deliver your paekli in mint condition.

&gt; paekli-cli receive --for jeremiah
Error: There is no paekli for jeremiah.

&gt; paekli-cli receive --for lisa
Here is your paekli:
carrots
</code></pre>
<p>You probably already initialized a <code>paekli-cli</code> package during the project setup.
If you haven't, simply run <code>cargo new paekli-cli</code> to do so.</p>
<p>Let's get started!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="command-line-argument-parsing"><a class="header" href="#command-line-argument-parsing">Command Line Argument Parsing</a></h1>
<p>The library we'll be using to write our CLI is called <code>clap</code>.
You can find its documentation as usual on <a href="https://docs.rs/clap">docs.rs/clap</a>.
There are other libraries to parse CLI-arguments, but <code>clap</code> is the most popular and user-friendly one.
The alternatives focus on fast compile times, which isn't a top-priority for <code>clap</code>.</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-dependency"><a class="header" href="#adding-the-dependency">Adding the dependency</a></h2>
<p>A small stumbling block for Rust's dependency management can be libraries with missing feature flags.
Helpfully, the output of <code>cargo add</code> shows us a list of included and excluded features.
I recommend to check this list every time you add a dependency and look for missing features you may want to include as well.
The coolest feature of <code>clap</code> is also its most compile-time heavy one, so it is gated behind a non-default feature flag called <code>derive</code>.</p>
<p>Let's add <code>clap</code> to our dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># cd paekli-cli
cargo add clap --features derive
</code></pre>
<p>If we forget about <code>--features derive</code>, some of the later code won't compile, and it wouldn't be obvious why.
We can confirm that it worked by checking that <code>paekli-cli/Cargo.toml</code> now contains the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
clap = { version = "4.5.1", features = ["derive"] }
</code></pre>
<h2 id="a-bare-bones-clap-app"><a class="header" href="#a-bare-bones-clap-app">A bare bones <code>clap</code>-app</a></h2>
<p>Here is the absolute minimum code to use clap:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use clap::Parser;

#[derive(Parser)]
struct Cli;

fn main() {
    let _args = Cli::parse();
    println!("Paekli LLC is currentli closed 😢");
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>What we're doing here is defining our CLI as a <em>data type</em>.
If you think about it, the structure of a standard CLI can easily be represented as a native Rust type.
For now, our <code>struct Cli;</code> is empty and therefore doesn't accept any arguments.</p>
<p>To parse the actual command line arguments into this data structure, we <code>#[derive(Parser)]</code> on it, which is a macro we imported with <code>use clap::Parser;</code>.
Finally, we simply call <code>Cli::parse();</code> in our main function.</p>
<p>If we run this program, we should get the same output as before.
So you'd be forgiven to think that didn't accomplish anything.
However, <code>clap</code> generates a help page for you, even if you don't specify a single CLI argument.
You can see it by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo run --quiet -- --help
</code></pre>
<p>Note how <code>--</code> is used to distinguish between the arguments passed to <code>cargo</code> and the ones passed to your program.
If we had a pre-compiled binary, we could simply run <code>paekli-cli --help</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cargo run --quiet -- --help
Usage: paekli-cli

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
</code></pre>
<p>It's great to have a standard help page, as is expected from every CLI tool.
It will automatically be kept up-to-date with the structure of our <code>Cli</code> data type, courtesy of Rust's powerful macros.</p>
<p>It is also good practice to let your users check which version of your program their running.
You wouldn't want to get bug reports for outdated software!
Change your <code>Cli</code> definition like so, to add a version flag:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[derive(Parser)]
#[clap(version)]
struct Cli;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Now observe the output of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo run --quiet -- --version
cargo run --quiet -- --help
</code></pre>
<p>We should also provide at least a small description of what paekli-cli does to our users.
<code>clap</code> automatically includes your doc-comments in the output to users, so let's add one to our CLI:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// send and receive joy with ✨ paekli-cli ✨
#[derive(Parser)]
#[clap(version)]
struct Cli;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note the tripe-slash <code>///</code>, which distinguished a doc-comment from a regular comment.
The comment should now show up on the help page.</p>
<p>Lovely!
That's a great foundation to build an enjoyable CLI on top of.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sending-and-receiving-paekli"><a class="header" href="#sending-and-receiving-paekli">Sending and Receiving Paekli</a></h1>
<p>It's time to build our first feature.
The most basic service we offer to our customers is <em>sending</em> and <em>receiving</em> paekli.
How should we model this in the CLI?
The most natural choice is the <strong>subcommand</strong>, which is often used by programs that offer many different functionalities.
For example: <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code> and <code>push</code> are subcommands of <code>git</code>.</p>
<div id="admonition-info" class="admonition admonish-info" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-info-title">
<div class="admonition-title">
<div id="admonition-info-title">
<p>Info</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="cli/send_receive.html#admonition-info"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>The code snippets in this guide will become less complete as we go along.
It is your responsibility to make sure the things you copy-paste integrate correctly with the rest of your code.
This is also because you are encouraged to add, modify and experiment with things according to your whim and curiosity.
It's <strong>your</strong> project after all! 😃</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Subcommands represent a choice out of a finite set of alternatives, that's a perfect fit for an <code>enum</code>.
Let's try it:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum Command {
    Send,
    Receive,
}

#[derive(Parser)]
struct Cli {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    command: Command,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The enum definition should be intuitive, but you'll notice the <code>#[derive(Subcommand)]</code> annotation.
In the struct <code>Cli</code>, we have to add the command as a field, again with a new annotation <code>#[command(subcommand)]</code>.</p>
<p>The compiler error messages for libraries that provide such annotation-based functionality are usually not very helpful, because the compiler cannot know what annotations you <em>should have added</em>.
For such libraries, it's best to refer to the documentation.
Because the libraries are aware of the bad error messages, they usually have great documentation and <code>clap</code> is no exception.</p>
<p>Now we can use the parsed subcommand in our main function:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">const SEND_MESSAGE: &amp;str = "\
Thank you for trusting Paekli LLC!
We will deliver your paekli in mint condition.
* throws your paekli directly in the trash *";

const RECEIVE_MESSAGE: &amp;str = "\
There aren't any paekli for you at the moment.
* tries to hide paekli in the trash can *";

fn main() {
    let args = Cli::parse();

    match args.command {
        Command::Send =&gt; println!("{SEND_MESSAGE}"),
        Command::Receive =&gt; println!("{RECEIVE_MESSAGE}"),
    }
}</code></pre></pre>
<div id="admonition-release" class="admonition admonish-success" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-release-title">

<div id="admonition-release-title">

</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="cli/send_receive.html#admonition-release"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>Phew!
We've made some great progress.
Let's cut a new release to let our users enjoy this new feature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="content-and-storage"><a class="header" href="#content-and-storage">Content and Storage</a></h1>
<p>At this point, our users can send and receive paekli.
However, they probably want to send paekli with some content and they want <em>that content to be received</em>.
Silly users with their unrealistic feature requests!</p>
<p>But let's try to make them happy.</p>
<h2 id="sending-paekli-with-content"><a class="header" href="#sending-paekli-with-content">Sending paekli with content</a></h2>
<p>The content of a paekli will be another CLI argument.
Since we only expect content when <em>sending</em> a paekli, we will add the argument to that subcommand.
Specifying the content of a paekli you're receiving doesn't make sense.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Command {
    Send { content: String },
    Receive,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We will also need to adjust the match-expression to ignore the content in our main function:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>Command::Send { content: _ } =&gt; println!("{SEND_MESSAGE}"),
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Now, try to send a paekli without content and see how the error message helps the user figure out how to use the CLI correctly.</p>
<h2 id="storing-paekli-for-delivery"><a class="header" href="#storing-paekli-for-delivery">Storing paekli for delivery</a></h2>
<p>Applications are expected to store their data in different locations depending on the operating system.
We might be tempted to tell our users to just install Linux when they're bugging us about supporting their platform.
Instead, let's use the <a href="https://docs.rs/directories">directories</a> crate to not have to worry about it at all.</p>
<p>Here's the code we'll need to add:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let project_dir = directories::ProjectDirs::from("dev", "buenzli", "paekli")
    .expect("the user's home directory seems to be corrupt");
let storage_dir = project_dir.data_dir();
std::fs::create_dir_all(storage_dir).expect("failed to create storage directory");

Command::Send { content } =&gt; {
    std::fs::write(storage_dir.join("content"), content)
        .expect("failed to store paekli");
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>On Linux, you can confirm that a paekli was sent correctly with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cat ~/.local/share/paekli/content
</code></pre>
<p>On Mac OS, find the paekli in Application Support:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/dev.buenzli.paekli/content
</code></pre>
<h2 id="less-than-terrible-error-handling"><a class="header" href="#less-than-terrible-error-handling">Less than terrible error handling</a></h2>
<p>We now have a few calls to <code>.expect()</code> in our code.
This is great for whipping up a quick program that works, but it immediately crashes our program in case of an error.
There are libraries for more scaleable error handling with great usability.
The most popular one for applications (as opposed to libraries) is <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow">anyhow</a>, so let's use that.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;()&gt; {
    // --snip --

    Ok(())
}</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>anyhow::Result</code> is a different type than <code>Result</code> from the standard library.
It only takes one type parameter for the <code>Ok</code> case.
The <code>Err</code> case always holds a value of type <code>anyhow::Error</code>.
This makes it easy to bubble up errors when they're all the same type.
Here we are returning <code>Result&lt;()&gt;</code>, because we don't return any value in the success case.
That means we now need to return <code>Ok(())</code> at the end of main.</p>
<details id="admonition-returning-result-from-main" class="admonition admonish-note" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-returning-result-from-main-title">
<summary class="admonition-title">
<div id="admonition-returning-result-from-main-title">
<p>returning Result from main</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="cli/content_storage.html#admonition-returning-result-from-main"></a>
</summary>
<div>
<p>You may not have known that the main function can actually return regular values.
This is mostly useful for returning <code>Result</code>s, so you can do normal Rust-style error handling in the main function.
However, <code>main</code> can technically return any type that implements the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/process/trait.Termination.html">Termination</a> trait.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>So, how do we refactor our <code>.expect()</code> calls to return <code>anyhow::Result</code> instead?
It's simple, first we import the trait <code>anyhow::Context</code>.
This attaches a new method <code>.context()</code> to any <code>Result</code> or <code>Option</code> to convert them into an <code>anyhow::Result</code>.
Recall that this pattern is sometimes called an "extension trait".
Lastly, we append the question mark operator <code>?</code> to the call of <code>.context()</code> in order to <em>return early</em> in case of an error.</p>
<p>visually:</p>
<pre><code>                               use anyhow::Context;
value.expect("error msg")  -&gt;  value.context("error msg")?
</code></pre>
<p>The practical difference is not that big yet, but future-you will probably thank us for starting early with good error handling.</p>

Here's a task you can do on your own:
Check if the file already exists, and if it does, do not overwrite it and notify the user that our storage is full.

<p>Contratulations!
We now have a fully-functioning minimum viable product (MVP).
The basic functions of sending and receiving work as expected.</p>
<p>Pat yourself on the back and cut a new release! 🥳</p>

</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="additional-features"><a class="header" href="#additional-features">Additional Features</a></h1>
<p>As we go along building our application, we will quickly want to add more features.
How to implement them for the CLI will be described in this section.
You will be mostly on your own, but guidance will be given where new concepts / libraries etc. are required.</p>
<p>You can choose to skip this section for now and explore the other components and integrations.
Just remember to come back here if some integration requires you to have these features implemented.
Jump to the <a href="cli/./where_next.html">next section</a> to explore other components and integrations or keep reading to implement more CLI features.</p>
<p>Once you're happy with the feature set of the CLI, don't forget to cut a new release!</p>
<h2 id="expanding-our-storage-space"><a class="header" href="#expanding-our-storage-space">Expanding our storage space</a></h2>
<p>Currently we can only store one paekli at a time.
Additional paekli are rejected until the existing one is received.
Instead of storing the paekli in a single file with a hardcoded name, let's store them in a directory instead.
The most obvious way to store multiple paekli is to use the time they were sent as their file name.
For that, you're gonna need a crate for time handling, like <code>time</code> or <code>chrono</code>.
<code>time</code> is very minimal, but sufficient for our use case.
I would've let you figure out how to use it yourself, but its documentation is hard to navigate in my opinion.
Just call <code>time::OffsetDateTime::now_utc().to_string()</code> to get the current time as a string.</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> just pick a random paekli out of the ones in storage whenever a paekli is received.
However, let's challenge ourselves by making sure the paekli are received in FIFO order.
The standard library function <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fs/fn.read_dir.html#platform-specific-behavior">read_dir</a> does not guarantee to yield directory entries in a platform-independent order.
The crate <code>walkdir</code> has a function <a href="https://docs.rs/walkdir/latest/walkdir/struct.WalkDir.html#method.sort_by">sort_by</a>, which could come in handy.
However, it should also be simple enough to implement this yourself.</p>
<h2 id="individual-recipients"><a class="header" href="#individual-recipients">Individual recipients</a></h2>
<p>When people send paekli, they usually have a specific recipient in mind.
In order to assign each paekli to a specific recipient, we need additional CLI arguments.
The sender of a paekli needs to say who should receive it and the recipient must identify themselves.</p>
<p>For the sender, we could just extend the <code>Send</code> subcommand to also accept a recipient, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>Send {
    content: String,
    recipient: String,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This works, and there's nothing terribly wrong with it.
However, CLI arguments defined this way are expected in a specific order.
(Namely the order in which they were defined in the struct).
As the number of arguments grows, it can become hard for users to get the order right.
To alleviate this, we can introduce <em>flags</em>, which are basically named arguments.
Because they are named, their order doesn't matter and it's always clear what's going to happen when typing in the command.
Using <code>clap</code> we can turn an argument into a flag by giving it a <em>short</em> and a <em>long</em> name.
(Or only one of the two, if we prefer.)</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>Send {
    content: String,
    #[arg(short, long)]
    recipient: String,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The recipient can now be specified with <code>-r NAME</code>, <code>--recipient NAME</code> or <code>--recipient=NAME</code>.
It seems reasonable to keep the <code>content</code> as a positional argument, as it is the most important part of a paekli.
However, you can turn that into a flag as well if you like.</p>
<p>You could also name the recipient flag <code>to</code>, which would enable a usage very close to natural English:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">paekli-cli send "cheddar cheese" --to Elizabeth
</code></pre>
<p>Renaming can be accomplished in the macro annotation as well:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>Send {
    content: String,
    #[arg(short('t'), long("to"))]
    recipient: String,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>To complete the feature, you will need to add a recipient argument or flag to the <code>Receive</code> subcommand as well.
Lastly, you'll need to change how you store and retrieve paekli so you can determine the intended recipient.</p>
<p>I will leave that up to you!</p>
<h2 id="express-delivery"><a class="header" href="#express-delivery">Express delivery</a></h2>
<p>Our paekli are currently always received in FIFO order.
However, what if some paekli was really important?
For example, a paekli containing a programmable ergonomic split mechanical keyboard with no less than eight keys on each thumb cluster?
Surely our users would like to receive such a marvelous paekli before all the other ones.</p>
<p>This feature will nicely demonstrate a boolean flag.
To implement one with <code>clap</code>, do the same as with a regular flag, but use a <code>bool</code> as its type instead of <code>String</code>.
The existence of the flag on the command line represents <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>The rest is up to you!</p>

<p>Most components don't have any requirements, so just pick one from the sidebar that interests you the most.
The few ones that do have requirements will say so at the beginning.</p>
<p>Note that for clients to be connected, some kind of server is required.
However, there is a reference implementation with API documentation hosted at <a href="https://paekli.buenzli.dev">paekli.buenzli.dev</a>.
Using that, you can connect all your clients without having to write a server yourself.
Thank you for being gentle to my server! 😊</p>
<p>If you are not the decisive kind, here's a little inspiration to help pick your next component:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="cli/../http.html">HTTP server</a> is fun and quite simple.
It has a good contrast to the CLI and it's always great to see through all layers of the stack.</li>
<li>I have a web development background, so I am particularly fond of the <a href="cli/../web_app.html">web app</a>.
It's portable, easy to deploy and doesn't use a single line of JavaScript 😎</li>
<li>Another goal that might be worth working towards:
Once you have a WebSocket-server and a GUI-client, you can make the GUI live-updating! 🤯</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="python-extension-module"><a class="header" href="#python-extension-module">Python Extension Module</a></h1>
<p>Python is a very popular language and there are many reasons we might want to interop with it.</p>
<p>For example, many Python libraries are written in more efficient languages like C and C++ under the hood.
Rust can fulfill that purpose just as well, if not better.
One such example that has generated some buzz recently is <a href="https://pola.rs/">polars</a>, a high-performance data frame library similar to pandas.</p>
<p>In addition, business applications are often written in Python at the start of a project for speed of development during the prototyping phase.
As the project matures, performance and reliability may become bigger concerns.
Instead of rewriting the whole thing in Rust in one fell swoop, it is more prudent to replace small pieces one step at a time.
This allows you to keep adding new features and deliver your software continuously during the transition phase.</p>
<p>Now that we're all hyped up, let's write a little Python library in Rust!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello World</a></h1>
<p>The most important project we'll be using for this component is <a href="https://pyo3.rs">PyO3</a>.
It does most of the heavy lifting for us so Python and Rust can talk to each other.
That means we have more time to write actual code.
Sweet!</p>
<p>Let's start by initializing a new package, sticking closely to PyO3's own guide.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">mkdir paekli-py
cd paekli-py
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
</code></pre>
<p>The PyO3 project has a build tool called <code>maturin</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pip install maturin
maturin init --bindings pyo3
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate a <em>Rust</em> project with the necessary boilerplate to use it as a Python module.
You might be interested to take a look at <code>Cargo.toml</code>, to see what kind of package configuration is needed.</p>
<p>Next, take some time to understand the generated <code>src/lib.rs</code>.
You'll notice the annotations <code>#[pyfunction]</code> and <code>#[pymodule]</code> are used to make Rust code available to Python.
There are also some Python-specific types like <code>PyResult</code> and <code>PyModule</code>.</p>
<p>Let's try to call the generated <code>sum_as_string</code> function from Python.
The following command installs our Rust module into the virtual Python environment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">maturin develop
</code></pre>
<p>Now the module <code>paekli_py</code> should be available to import from Python:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import paekli_py
&gt;&gt;&gt; paekli_py.sum_as_string(123, 678)
'801'
</code></pre>

</div>
<div>
<p>Hurray!
You can now call Rust code from Python 🥳</p>
<p>For most components, we put effort in a continuous release workflow.
However, we won't do that for the Python extension module.</p>
<p>If you simply want to extend your own Python code with Rust, there is no loss.
If you do want to publish a Python module on PyPI, I encourage you to explore that on your own.</p>
<p><code>maturin</code> actually generates a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically publish to PyPI.
It won't be active by default, because it's not at the root of the Git repository.
You can delete it or leave it, doesn't matter.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sending-and-receiving-paekli-1"><a class="header" href="#sending-and-receiving-paekli-1">Sending and Receiving Paekli</a></h1>
<p>Let' start implementing the two basic interactions with the system.
They're just going to be two stubbed-out functions for now.
Remember to add them explicitly to your module!</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// Send a paekli
#[pyfunction]
fn send() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
    SEND_MESSAGE
}
#[pymodule]
fn paekli_py(_py: Python, m: &amp;PyModule) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(send, m)?)?;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>That was easy!
You should be able to confirm your changes with something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import paekli_py

print(paekli_py.send())
print(paekli_py.receive())
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="content-and-storage-1"><a class="header" href="#content-and-storage-1">Content and Storage</a></h1>

</div>
<div>
<p>This guide assumes you have created the <a href="python_module//storage_backend.html">storage backend abstraction</a>.
If you haven't, I recommend you do it now.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Accepting input from Python is simple enough, you just declare the parameters in the function that you need.
It's just like writing regular Rust.</p>
<p>To express that the function might fail but there's no output in the success case, we can use <code>PyResult&lt;()&gt;</code> as the return type.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn send(_content: &amp;str) -&gt; PyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    Ok(())
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Are you wondering about how it's possible that we're simply writing Rust code, including input parameters and return types, and Python can just call those functions?</p>
<p>The magic lies with the <code>#[pyfunction]</code> macro, which generates the glue code necessary to convert between Python and Rust values across the FFI boundary.
You can make your own Rust types able to pass the FFI boundary to Python by implementing the traits <code>FromPyObject</code> (derivable) and <code>IntoPy&lt;PyObject&gt;</code>.
If you're curious, you can read more about these conversions <a href="https://pyo3.rs/v0.21.0-beta.0/conversions">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="storing-paekli"><a class="header" href="#storing-paekli">Storing paekli</a></h2>
<p>Using our storage backend abstraction, we'll be done with this in no time.
Remember that you need to add <code>paekli-core</code> as a path dependency to <code>paekli-py</code>.</p>
<p>You should have a function to get access to a <code>DistributionCenter</code>, e.g. <code>paekli_core::new_distribution_center()</code>.
If you have more than one storage backend already (or a configurable one), that function probably takes additional arguments.</p>
<p>Next, you just call <code>.store()</code> or <code>.retrieve()</code> on the distribution center with the arguments received from the Python code.
Easy-peasy.</p>
<div id="admonition-success" class="admonition admonish-success" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-success-title">

<div id="admonition-success-title">
<p>Success</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="python_module/content_storage.html#admonition-success"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>That was super fast!
PyO3 and our storage backend did almost all the work.</p>
<p>If you have the CLI already, you should be able to send and receive paekli between it and Python (assuming the same storage backend).</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="additional-features-1"><a class="header" href="#additional-features-1">Additional Features</a></h1>
<p>Now you have the opportunity to bring the Python extension module to feature-parity if you have already implemented the additional features for another component.</p>
<p>As your Python functions accumulate more parameters, you may want to use optional and keyword arguments, which are idiomatic in Python.
I have good news for you, there is little work to be done to achieve that.
From the <a href="https://pyo3.rs/v0.21.0-beta.0/function/signature">PyO3 documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like Python, by default PyO3 accepts all arguments as either positional or keyword arguments.
Most arguments are required by default, except for trailing <code>Option&lt;_&gt;</code> arguments, which are implicitly given a default of <code>None</code>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="web-app"><a class="header" href="#web-app">Web App</a></h1>
<p>Interested in building a web app with Rust, I see?
I understand you.
For too long, JavaScript has held the industry hostage with its iron grip on the browser.</p>
<p>Even if you are not yet traumatized by JavaScript, web apps are just so darn useful.
They are extremely easy to deploy and arguably the most platform-independent way to make a GUI.</p>
<p>There is good news for the mental health of web developers around the globe:
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> (short: wasm) is a byte code supported by all major browsers since 2017.
Finally, we have a real alternative to JavaScript!
Wasm quite low-level and intended as a compilation target.
Rust has industry-leading support for compiling to wasm, so it is a surprisingly good choice for building web apps.</p>
<div id="admonition-requirements" class="admonition admonish-note" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-requirements-title">
<div class="admonition-title">
<div id="admonition-requirements-title">
<p>Requirements</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="web_app.html#admonition-requirements"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>For building a web app, we need some basic knowledge about HTML.
This guide will not provide that.
If you know nothing about HTML, you should still be able to follow along until the MVP, but going beyond that will be frustrating if not impossible.
Knowledge of some JavaScript UI-framework like React, Angular, Vue etc. are benefitial but not required.
(The library we'll be using is most similar to Solid.)
If you know about CSS or Tailwind, feel free to make the app as pretty as you like! ✨</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Due to its nature, this component is relatively library-heavy.
The browser is not really the <em>native</em> environment of Rust, so we need a bit of cushioning to get comfortable.
We're gonna need a UI-rendering library that's made for the web, one that provides wrappers of browser APIs that are only available to JavaScript as well as an additional build tool.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hello-world-1"><a class="header" href="#hello-world-1">Hello World</a></h1>
<p>Fair warning: The web app has a bit more setup than the other components.
Don't worry though, we'll manage just fine together!</p>
<h2 id="installing-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#installing-dependencies">Installing dependencies</a></h2>
<p>When you install the Rust toolchain, it only supports compiling to your native platform by default.
To add support to compile to WebAssembly, let's add the necessary target:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
</code></pre>
<p>We're gonna use a <em>bundler</em> called <a href="https://trunkrs.dev/">trunk</a> to help us manage all the boilerplate around a web app:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo install --locked trunk
</code></pre>
<p>Let's initialize a new package for the web app:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo new paekli-web
</code></pre>
<p>Add a couple libraries we'll need:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd paekli-web
cargo add gloo
cargo add leptos --features csr
cargo add console_error_panic_hook
</code></pre>
<p>Trunk puts its output into a different directory than cargo, you probably want to git-ignore that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># still inside paekli-web/
echo dist &gt; .gitignore
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dummy-indexhtml"><a class="header" href="#dummy-indexhtml">Dummy <code>index.html</code></a></h2>
<p>A normal, plain website might be nothing more than an HTML file.
That's exactly how our web app is going to <em>start</em> as: a plain HTML file without any content.
Its only purpose is to load the wasm code that generates the interactive web app.
Hopefully that makes sense, but if it doesn't, don't worry.
I'm just trying to explain why we need the following boilerplate.</p>
<p>Add an <code>index.html</code> <em>next to your Cargo.toml</em>.
The location is important.
Add the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Hello Rust Workshop!&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That's already enough to get the (empty) web app off the ground.
Let's start the development server of our bundler <code>trunk</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">trunk serve
</code></pre>
<p>It might take a minute to compile the first time, but then it should display a URL where you can see your web app.
It's probably <a href="http://localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a>.</p>
<p>The page will be empty (because of the empty <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag), but the custom title should be visible in the browser tab.</p>
<h2 id="running-rust-in-the-browser"><a class="header" href="#running-rust-in-the-browser">Running Rust in the browser</a></h2>
<p>So far, we haven't actually written any Rust that compiles to wasm to run in the browser.
Let's change that.
How about this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use leptos::*;

fn main() {
    mount_to_body(|| {
        view! {
            &lt;h1&gt;Hello WebAssembly!&lt;/h1&gt;
        }
    })
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If you add this change to <code>main.rs</code> while you keep <code>trunk serve</code> running, your web app should automatically recompile and <em>reload in the browser</em> once compilation is done.
Pretty decent development experience!
Can you see the result in the browser?</p>
<p>Let's explain a little bit what's going on here.
Remember the empty <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> from the <code>index.html</code>?
This body tag is the container of all the content on a website.
With the function <code>mount_to_body</code>, we're letting our Rust code take over the body tag and therefore the entire content of the website.
The argument passed to <code>mount_to_body</code> is a simple function (notice that <code>||</code> is in this case the start of a <em>closure</em> without any arguments).
The function returns a <code>view!</code> macro with the content <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello WebAssembly!&lt;/h1&gt;</code>.
The <code>view!</code> macro allows us to write HTML-like syntax which will be inserted into the website.
This might look alien to you, but it's very convenient for seasoned web developers and pervasive in the JavaScript world.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-decent-error-messages"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-decent-error-messages">Setting up decent error messages</a></h2>
<p>We're still inexperienced when it comes to web development with Rust, so we might make a mistake or two.
If our app crashes, it would be nice to get some decent error message.
Let's add the following at the top of our main function:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>console_error_panic_hook::set_once();
panic!("I don't know what to do!");
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In the browser, the "Hello WebAssembly" text should be gone.
This is because the app crashed before it was able to display the text.
If you open the browser dev tools with <code>F12</code> and click on the "Console" tab, you should see our custom error message and a line number.
That's good enough for our purposes!</p>
<p>Remove the <code>panic!</code> statement (but keep the panic hook) and your app should work again.</p>

<p>Congratulations!
You are now a fully-oxidized web developer 🥳</p>
<p>You might expect me to pester you about cuttting a relaeas at this point.
But setting up the release of the web app is a little more work, so it deserves its own section.
It'll be worth it though!
In contrast to the other components, your users <em>won't even have to install your web app</em>.
We will be deploying to GitHub Pages, freely accessible to anyone who can click a link!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="github-pages"><a class="header" href="#github-pages">GitHub Pages</a></h1>
<p>GitHub Pages is a free static website hosting service.
It's very convenient to have a nice website for your GitHub projects.
However, if your project is precisely a website, GitHub Pages can be used as the actual deployment!</p>
<p>This section is mostly about how to write a GitHub Action to automate that deployment process.
It's not too much work, so let's get started.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-workflow-for-automatic-deployment"><a class="header" href="#a-new-workflow-for-automatic-deployment">A new workflow for automatic deployment</a></h2>
<p>First, we need a new workflow.
There should already be a couple in <code>.github/workflows</code>.
Let's create the file <code>.github/workflows/gh_pages.yml</code>.</p>
<p>Our workflow should run every time we push to the main branch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">name: GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: main
</code></pre>
<p>It's also gonna need write-access to our repository, so it can make a commit where the finished website will be stored.
Don't worry, that commit won't be polluting the main branch.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">permissions:
  contents: write
</code></pre>
<p>We're gonna have a single job to run in the default Ubuntu environment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">jobs:
  pages:
    name: Deploy GitHub Pages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to define the steps to run.
The first step is the same for almost all workflows: <code>uses: actions/checkout</code> to get access to the code of the repository itself.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
</code></pre>
<p>Next up we'll use <code>Swatinem/rust-cache@v2</code> to cache our build.
This will speed up future builds quite a bit, because dependencies won't have to download and compile every time.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
</code></pre>
<p>The rest is basically just bash scripting:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml">      - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
      - run: |
          rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
          cd paekli-web
          wget -qO- https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/releases/download/v0.19.0/trunk-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar -xzf-
          ./trunk build --release --public-url /paekli-rs
          mv dist ../docs
          git config --global user.name "GitHub Actions Bot"
          git config --global user.email "bot@invalid.local"
          git checkout -b gh-pages
          git add ../docs
          git commit --message "GitHub Pages Deployment"
          git push --force --set-upstream origin gh-pages
</code></pre>
<p>If you prefer, you can put this script in a regular <code>.sh</code> file in your repository so it can be tested more easily.</p>
<p>Let's explain a couple things that might not be obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> is needed to compile Rust to WebAssembly.</li>
<li>The <code>wget</code> command downloads a binary of <code>trunk</code> into the current directory.</li>
<li>The <code>--public-url /rust-exercises</code> is necessary because our website is not located at the root path of the domain.</li>
<li>We move the <code>dist</code> folder to <code>rust-exercises/docs</code> because that's where GitHub Pages expects our website to be located for deployment.</li>
<li>The git configuration of username and email is irrelevant, these commits will be overwritten regularly.</li>
<li>Lastly, we force push the built website to a branch called <code>gh-pages</code>.
More on that next.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enabling-github-pages"><a class="header" href="#enabling-github-pages">Enabling GitHub Pages</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>go to GitHub</li>
<li>navigate to your repo</li>
<li>go to the "Settings" tab</li>
<li>click on "Pages" in the sidebar</li>
<li>under "Source", "Deploy from a branch" should already be selected</li>
<li>under "Branch", change "None" to "gh-actions" and "/ (root)" to "/docs"</li>
</ol>
<p>And that should be it!
With this configuration, GitHub Pages will look inside the <code>/docs</code> directory of your repository on the <code>gh-actions</code> branch for a website to deploy.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sending-and-receiving"><a class="header" href="#sending-and-receiving">Sending and Receiving</a></h1>
<p>Let' start implementing the two basic interactions with the system.</p>
<p>First we'll need an HTML button the user can click on:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>view! {
    &lt;button&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>That's great, but it doesn't to anything yet.
To make the button functional, we'll attach a function to the button, such that the function will be executed when the button is clicked.
If this looks kinda magical to you, then that's because it is.
The <code>view!</code> macro is doing <em>a lot</em> of heavy lifting here.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use gloo::dialogs::alert;

view! {
    &lt;button
        on:click=|_| alert("paekli was sent!")
    &gt;
        Send
    &lt;/button&gt;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Apart from the formatting, what has changed?
We gave a new "attribute" to the button tag, although it's not quite valid HTML.
The <code>on:click</code> "attribute" is the special way to attach event handlers to DOM elements in <code>leptos</code>.
(In the JavaScript world, React has the almost identical <code>onClick</code>.)
The value of the special attribute is a function or <em>closure</em>.
It takes one parameter but ignores it.
The parameter would've been an click-event object with some metadata about what triggered the button-press.
The body of the function calls <code>gloo::dialogs::alert</code>, which is a binding to the alert API of the browser.
It should create a little pop-up window with the given text.</p>
<p>Check in your browser if this behaves the way you would expect!</p>
<p>Then, add a second button for receiving paekli.</p>
<div id="admonition-release" class="admonition admonish-success" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-release-title">
<div class="admonition-title">
<div id="admonition-release-title">
<p>Release</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="web_app/send_receive.html#admonition-release"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>The buttons aren't very useful yet, but let's not make our users wait for any new features.
Cut a new release by pushing these changes to the main branch.</p>
<p>Remember, for the web app you don't even have to push a version tag to trigger a release.
The version tag is the trigger for <code>cargo dist</code>, which manages our downloadable binaries.
The GitHub Pages deployment is triggered by every push to main.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="content-and-storage-2"><a class="header" href="#content-and-storage-2">Content and Storage</a></h1>
<p>Accepting user input in HTML is simple enough:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;input placeholder="paekli content"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You should already be able to use this text field in the browser.
However, it's not obvious how our Rust code can access the text our user types in.</p>
<h2 id="storing-values-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#storing-values-in-rust">Storing values in Rust</a></h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to do this, but we'll go with the simplest route.
We'll create a variable in our Rust code where the text will be stored and instruct the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element to update the value of that variable when the user types in a character.
A regular <code>let mut</code> variable doesn't quite cut it though, we'll need a special type from the <code>leptos</code> library called a <code>Signal</code>.
But the principle is exactly the same!</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// reading and writing of the signal are separated into two variables
let (get_content, set_content) = create_signal(String::default());

view! {
    &lt;input
        placeholder="paekli content"
        prop:value=move || get_content.get()
        on:input=move |e| set_content.set(event_target_value(&amp;e))
    &gt;&lt;/input&gt;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Alright, I'll explain this in a second.
But first, you're probably getting a compiler error at this point.
It says something like:</p>
<div id="admonition-compiler-error" class="admonition admonish-failure" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-compiler-error-title">
<div class="admonition-title">
<div id="admonition-compiler-error-title">
<p>compiler error</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="web_app/content_storage.html#admonition-compiler-error"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>bla bla <strong>closure may outlive the current function</strong> bla bla <strong>use the <code>move</code> keyword</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Okay, that sounds kinda difficult.
It's related to Rust's lifetime system.
The fundamental problem here is that user interfaces are long-lived programs where is becomes harder for the borrow checker to make sure you're not using some value after it isn't valid anymore.
Luckily, the developers of the <code>leptos</code> library have a perfect solution for this problem and the Rust compiler <em>even tells us the correct thing to do</em>.
We have to put the <code>move</code> keyword in front of the closure passed to <code>mount_to_body</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>mount_to_body(move || {
    // ...
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The only downside of this solution is that it's not obvious at all what's going on.
To truly understand it, one needs decent experience with the borrow checker and a good understanding of how the <code>leptos</code> library works internally.
Needless to say, this is beyond the scope of this guide.
So for now, I can only tell you to "trust me bro" and <code>move</code> all the closures!</p>
<p>Alright, I still owe you an explanation of the code snippet above.
First we create a "signal", <code>leptos</code> special variable type that's separated into a getter and setter function.
The reason we need a signal instead of a regular variable is because leptos automatically updates all the places in the UI where the signal is used when it changes.
That's not something we would be able to do with regular variables.
We control the current content of the input field with the <code>prop:value</code> attribute.
It's value is a function that returns the current content of the signal.
That way, the input field and the signal are always in sync.
We also have a new event handler for the <code>on:input</code> event.
This function will be executed every time the user changes the content of the input field.
The function accepts an event <code>e</code> and sets the value of the signal to the <code>event_target_value</code> of <code>e</code>, which is precisely the new content of the input field.
"Event", "target" and "value" are all terms with specific meaning in the world of browsers and web development, so don't worry about it too much if it seems alien to you.</p>
<p>You can read more about the nuances of handling user input in the <a href="https://book.leptos.dev/view/05_forms.html">Leptos documentation</a>.</p>
<p>You might find <code>get_content.get()</code> and <code>set_content.set()</code> a little verbose.
There is a nicer way to write this, but it requires the nightly compiler for now, so I chose to avoid it.</p>
<p>Just one last thing, let's display the paekli content in the alert when sending it, to confirm everything works as expected:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>&lt;button
    on:click=move |_| alert(&amp;format!("paekli with {} was sent!", get_content.get()))
&gt;
    Send
&lt;/button&gt;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Now enter some text, click send and observe that the correct value is displayed.</p>
<p>Phew.
I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted now.
Feel free to take a break, web development is hard! 😮‍💨</p>
<h2 id="paekli-storage"><a class="header" href="#paekli-storage">Paekli storage</a></h2>
<p>We now have a signal to store the input of our users.
But we should probably clear that when a paekli is sent and commit the content to a different signal.
Otherwise we cannot distinguish between paekli content that was actually sent and the user just derping around in the text field.</p>
<p>I think you can manage on own.
I believe in you!! 💪</p>
<h2 id="receiving-paekli"><a class="header" href="#receiving-paekli">Receiving paekli</a></h2>
<p>I'll leave this up to you as well.

You should be mostly fine on your own with everything we've seen so far.
You'll need more (complicated) signals to store additional data and more user input.</p>
<p>However, half the fun of the web app is integrating it with the HTTP server.

<p>The web app is a bit more limited in the set of integrations it supports, because it runs in the browser.
For example, a web app cannot talk to a Unix socket or SQLite database.</p>
<p>However, there are fantastic integrations with technologies native to the browser.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have of course the HTTP server.
This is the place to start if you want to connect your web app to your other components.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is WebSocket.
This technology enables a web app and a server to have an ongoing connection where both sides can initiate messages.
HTTP already enables client-to-server initiated messages, so the really interesting part is is server-to-client initiated messages via websocket.
In simple terms: <strong>push notifications</strong>!
That means with websocket, your web app can instantaneously update its GUI when your server receives a new paekli from a completely unrelated component.</p>
<p>The way to get there involves a couple steps though.
You probably want to have an HTTP server already, otherwise stuff just gets more complicated (even though it's possible).
Then you'll need to implement the websocket server, shared message types in the <a href="web_app/../shared_lib.html">shared library</a> and then integrate an ongoing websocket connection into your web app.
For the exciting Aha!-moment, you'll also need another component to be integrated with the HTTP server, for example the CLI.</p>
<p>You get the point, it's a decent chunk of work.
Don't worry though, I'll be there to help at every step!
Just be prepared to spend some time on this if you choose to accept the challenge.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="http-server"><a class="header" href="#http-server">HTTP Server</a></h1>
<p>HTTP servers are lots of fun!
They are simple and versatile, allowing you to make your application available anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
<p>This guide does <strong>not</strong> assume any prior knowledge about writing web servers.
So don't be scared if you've never done this before!
If you're already a battle-hardened web dev, you can simply skip over the explanations of the basics.</p>
<p>What we're going to build here is sometimes also referred to as a REST-API.
We're not gonna be too strict about that term though, we'll just stick to the basic conventions of web development.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what the product might look like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; curl --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       --data '{ "content": "strawberries" }' \
       https://paekli.buenzli.dev/paekli

&gt; curl --request DELETE https://paekli.buenzli.dev/paekli
{"content":"strawberries"}
</code></pre>
<p>The curl commands are a little verbose, but this is not the primary intended use case.
The point is that the sender and the recipient could be completely different devices and clients on the network!</p>
<p>This guide assumes that you already created <a href="cli.html">the CLI component</a>.
You can totally follow it if you haven't, but there will be fewer explanations of the basic steps.</p>
<p>Let's get started!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-hello-world-of-http-servers"><a class="header" href="#the-hello-world-of-http-servers">The Hello World of HTTP Servers</a></h1>
<h2 id="initializing-a-new-package"><a class="header" href="#initializing-a-new-package">Initializing a new package</a></h2>
<p>Just like for the CLI, we'll work with a new binary crate <code>paekli-http</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo new paekli-http
</code></pre>
<h2 id="axum"><a class="header" href="#axum">Axum</a></h2>
<p>There are many great choices for web-server libraries in Rust.
<a href="https://blessed.rs/crates#section-networking-subsection-http-foundations">blessed.rs</a> lists a few of them.
But I'm the one writing this book, so I get to decide.
<a href="https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/">Axum</a> is simple, modular, performant, well-maintained and popular.
You can't go wrong with it!</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># cd paekli-http
cargo add axum --features macros
</code></pre>
<p>We don't actually need the feature flag <code>macros</code> for any functionality, but it has a handy tool to improve error messages in case we make a mistake.</p>
<div id="admonition-async" class="admonition admonish-info" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-async-title">
<div class="admonition-title">
<div id="admonition-async-title">
<p>async</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="http/hello_world.html#admonition-async"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>Axum - as most other web-server libraries in Rust - makes use of a language feature called "asynchronous IO" or simply <code>async</code>.
Some other languages have similar features, including C#, JavaScript and Python, so you might be familiar with it.</p>
<p>We will <em>completely ignore</em> that stuff in this guide, because there's quite a bit to learn about it and it really only matters for performance.</p>
<p>You will however see some stuff that might seem weird if you don't know about <code>asnyc</code>.
The guide will point it out as well and remind you not to worry about it.</p>
<p>If you want to get serious about writing web-servers in Rust, it's definitely a good idea to learn about <code>async</code> on your own.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="tokio"><a class="header" href="#tokio">Tokio</a></h2>
<p>Every Rust-program that makes use of <code>async</code> must have a so-called <em>async runtime</em>.
This will be <a href="https://tokio.rs/">tokio</a> in our case, it's pretty much the "default" one in the ecosystem.
Tokio has many feature-flags, let's enable all of them to not have to worry about it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo add tokio --features full
</code></pre>
<p>We will let the tokio runtime take over our main function, so let's add this goofy-looking setup:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now, if you <code>cargo run</code> your project, it should still print "Hello, world!".</p>
<h2 id="spinning-up-a-useless-http-server"><a class="header" href="#spinning-up-a-useless-http-server">Spinning up a useless HTTP server</a></h2>
<p>We're not quite done with the boilerplate yet:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">async fn main() {
    let router = axum::Router::new();

    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:3000").await.unwrap();

    axum::serve(listener, router).await.unwrap();
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Confused about the <code>.await</code>?
Don't worry about it, it's <code>async</code> stuff 🤫</p>
<p>Here we are creating a <code>Router</code> from the <code>axum</code> library.
The router is responsible for deciding how to handle incoming HTTP requests.
Right now, it doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>After that, we create a TCP-listener with the <code>tokio</code> library and bind it to the port <code>3000</code>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we use the function <code>axum::serve</code> to make our previously created router respond to incoming requests on that TCP-listener.</p>
<p>If you <code>cargo run</code> this, there won't be any output in the terminal.
However, you can already send requests and receive responses:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; curl --verbose 0.0.0.0:3000
* processing: 0.0.0.0:3000
*   Trying 0.0.0.0:3000...
* Connected to 0.0.0.0 (127.0.0.1) port 3000
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: 0.0.0.0:3000
&gt; User-Agent: curl/8.2.1
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt;
&lt; HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
&lt; content-length: 0
&lt; date: Fri, 08 Mar 2024 07:13:00 GMT
&lt;
* Connection #0 to host 0.0.0.0 left intact
</code></pre>
<p>This is using <code>curl</code> to send an empty HTTP request to our server.
Among all this HTTP-gobbledygook, the most interesting piece is <code>404 Not Found</code>.
I'm sure you've already seen this response in the browser!</p>
<p>So our server is telling us <em>it didn't find the thing we were asking for</em>, which is a reasonable default chosen by the <code>axum</code> library.</p>
<h2 id="handling-our-first-request"><a class="header" href="#handling-our-first-request">Handling our first request</a></h2>
<p>Let's write a simple function that will be responsible for handling a request:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>async fn hello_world() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
    "hello world"
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>All HTTP handlers need the <code>async</code> keyword before <code>fn</code>.
Don't worry about it 🙂</p>
<p>Now we can tell the <em>router</em> to let some requests be handled by this function:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use axum::routing::get;

async fn main() {
    let router = axum::Router::new().route("/", get(hello_world));
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The router needs two pieces of information to decide which handler is responsible for an incoming request:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"/"</code> is the so-called <strong>path</strong>.
It corresponds to the part of a URL after the <em>domain</em>.
For example, if you go to <a href="https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/struct.Router.html">docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/struct.Router.html</a> in your browser, the request you're sending has the path <code>/axum/latest/axum/struct.Router.html</code>.</li>
<li><code>get(hello_world)</code> tells axum that only requests with the method <code>GET</code> should be handled.
The <strong>method</strong> is a part of the HTTP protocol and <code>GET</code> is the default one.
We'll see more methods later on.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will learn about bits and pieces of the HTTP protocol as we need them.</p>
<p>If we take a second look at the output of the <code>curl</code> command from above, we might notice this line:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>
<p>This is saying exactly that <code>curl</code> sent a request with the method <code>GET</code> and the path <code>/</code>.
That means our request should now be handled!
Let's try again, (remember to restart the server with <code>cargo run</code>):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; curl 0.0.0.0:3000
hello world
</code></pre>
<p>Hurray!
You should also see the greeting when you navigate to <a href="http://0.0.0.0:3000">http://0.0.0.0:3000</a> in the browser.</p>
<h2 id="shipping-the-first-version"><a class="header" href="#shipping-the-first-version">Shipping the first version</a></h2>
<p>Let's again make sure we can release our software efficiently.
Remember that you should use a version number that is higher than the last one you used for any other component.
Otherwise, our distribution-tool <code>cargo-dist</code> might get confused.</p>
<p>Assuming the last highest version used was <code>0.1.9</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># paekli-http/Cargo.toml
version = "0.1.10"
</code></pre>
<p>With those changes: git commit, push, tag and push the tag!</p>

<p>Our server can now say hello, but we want it to help us send and receive paekli.
Let's stub out a handler for each type of request.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[axum::debug_handler]
async fn send_paekli() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
    "\
Thank you for trusting Paekli LLC!
We will deliver your paekli in mint condition.
* throws your paekli directly in the trash *"
}

#[axum::debug_handler]
async fn receive_paekli() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
    "\
There aren't any paekli for you at the moment.
* tries to hide paekli in the trash can *"
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note the new <code>#[debug_handler]</code> attribute above the handler function.
This is what we needed <code>--features macros</code> for when we added the <code>axum</code> dependency.
It is a macro that provides better error messages in case there's something wrong with our handler function.
I recommend you add it to <strong>every</strong> new handler you're going to write.
I also recommend not making any mistakes in the first place, but... you know.</p>
<h2 id="picking-the-right-http-method"><a class="header" href="#picking-the-right-http-method">Picking the right HTTP method</a></h2>
<p>We have already seen the HTTP method <code>GET</code>, which is the default one.
It is used to ask a server for some information.
There are other methods with specific meanings, the most common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GET</code> for reading data</li>
<li><code>POST</code> for storing new data</li>
<li><code>PUT</code> for modifying existing data</li>
<li><code>DELETE</code> for deleting data</li>
</ul>
<p>These four methods cover all the operations that are commonly performed on data.</p>
<p><code>POST</code> is the method that most closely matches the operation of sending a paekli, because the server will need to store a new piece of data. <code>DELETE</code> seems appropriate for receiving, since the paekli should be deleted on the server after it has been received.</p>
<p>Recall that the router also needs a <em>path</em> to register a handler, but we won't have to worry about that.
We just use the empty or "root" path.
The <em>path</em> is conventionally used to specify a resource.
Since we only have one resource (paekli), the path doesn't matter.
Here's how we can register these new handlers with different HTTP methods:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let router = axum::Router::new()
    .route("/", post(send_paekli))
    .route("/", delete(receive_paekli));
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's try them out:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; curl --request POST 0.0.0.0:3000

<p>Great!
We can now execute different functions based on the incoming request.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="content-and-storage-3"><a class="header" href="#content-and-storage-3">Content and Storage</a></h1>
<p>The send- and receive-handler are just dummies at this point, let's change that.</p>
<h2 id="sending-paekli-with-content-1"><a class="header" href="#sending-paekli-with-content-1">Sending paekli with content</a></h2>
<p>These days, it is common to use JSON to transmit information via HTTP.
We have already seen how the libraries <code>serde</code> and <code>serde_json</code> make JSON handling a walk in the park.</p>
<p>The content of a paekli will be another CLI argument.
Since we only expect content when <em>sending</em> a paekli, we will add the argument to that subcommand.
Specifying the content of a paekli you're receiving doesn't make sense.
When adding <code>serde</code>, don't forget the <code>derive</code> feature.</p>
<p>Let's define the structure of the input we are expecting to our send handler, it's simple enough:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct SendRequest {
    content: String,
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Now we're about to see the fun part of <code>axum</code>.
We can simply add a <code>Json&lt;SendRequest&gt;</code> to the parameters of our handler.
The <code>Json</code> type is from the <code>axum</code> library and instructs it to take the body of an incoming HTTP request, deserialize it into the specified type (<code>SendRequest</code>) and pass it into the handler function.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>async fn send_paekli(Json(request): Json&lt;SendRequest&gt;) {
    println!("sending: {}", request.content);
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This is very cool and avoids boilerplate, but it's not without its downsides.
The types and order of parameters and the return type of your handler function have great significance for the behavior of your server.
That being said, the <code>#[axum::debug_handler]</code> should go a long way in helping with that.</p>
<p>Let's explore how our changes affected the behavior of our send-handler:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; curl --request POST 0.0.0.0:3000
Expected request with `Content-Type: application/json`
</code></pre>
<p>If we don't send a body with our request, we will be told that some JSON was expected.
Not too bad!
Just by adding a typed parameter to our function, <code>axum</code> generates meaningful error messages for us.
Let's lie to the server in the request by saying that we're sending JSON, without actually doing it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; curl --request POST \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    0.0.0.0:3000
Failed to parse the request body as JSON: EOF while parsing a value at line 1 column 0
</code></pre>
<p>We're being told the JSON we sent was invalid, that's also reasonable.
What about valid JSON that doesn't contain the required <code>content: String</code>?</p>
<pre><code>&gt; curl --request POST \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{ "some_other_stuff": 1234 }' \
    0.0.0.0:3000
Failed to deserialize the JSON body into the target type: missing field `content` at line 1 column 28
</code></pre>
<p>Awesome.
With very little code, we're getting perfect validation and good errors every step along the way.
For completeness' sake, here's a correct example:</p>
<pre><code>❯ curl --request POST \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{ "content": "Legos" }' \
    0.0.0.0:3000

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>curl</code> commands are getting quite verbose at this point.
You might want to keep a file or even a script with a bunch of them.
The HTTP server component is not primarily intended for direct user interaction, but rather to connect other, local components with each other.
However, that will be part of the integrations.</p>
<h2 id="storing-paekli-for-delivery-1"><a class="header" href="#storing-paekli-for-delivery-1">Storing paekli for delivery</a></h2>
<p>We could do the same as with the CLI and store the paekli in the file system.
But at that point, we would be duplicating the code interacting with the file system.
If we made a mistake or changed something in one place but not the other, it could lead to data corruption.
The solution to this is a shared storage backend, which is a component you can implement later.
For now, we're intentionally going to implement a <em>terrible</em> way to store our data:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>static PAEKLI_STORAGE: Mutex&lt;Option&lt;String&gt;&gt; = Mutex::new(None);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><em>Global mutable state</em>.
Are you as disgusted as I am?
Great, this will give you motivation to implement the shared storage backend component later 😉
Here is how you can store an incoming paekli:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let mut guard = PAEKLI_STORE.lock().unwrap();
*guard = Some(request.content);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We're not handing the error-case where a paekli exists already for now.</p>
<h3 id="delivering-paekli-1"><a class="header" href="#delivering-paekli-1">Delivering paekli</a></h3>
<p>Again, I'll leave the delivery of the paekli up to you.</p>
<p>If you are interested in doing idiomatic error-handling both in terms of Rust and web standards, here's the type your handler should probably return:</p>
<p><code>-&gt; Result&lt;Json&lt;ReceiveResponse&gt;, StatusCode&gt;</code></p>
<p>In the success-case, a JSON-formatted response with whatever information the custom type <code>ReceiveResponse</code> holds.
In the error-case, an HTTP status code.
<code>404 Not Found</code> seems like a reasonable choice, in case there is no paekli.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="additional-features-3"><a class="header" href="#additional-features-3">Additional Features</a></h1>
<p>Now you have the opportunity to bring the HTTP server to feature-parity if you have already implemented the additional features for the CLI.
However, note that it will require you to make the already bad storage system even worse.
So I will softly recommend to you to implement a storage backend first.
The file system storage backend should be easy to do, because most code can be copied from the CLI.</p>
<p>If you're not the type to finish what you've started, you can always do something new instead!
Here's the guide on <a href="http/./where_next.html">where to go next</a>.</p>
<p>There's one more thing to consider when implementing these additional features for the HTTP server.
If you implement them in a way that they are <em>required</em>, then that means all you client components will have to implement the feature before being compatible with your HTTP server.
For example, your server might <em>require</em> that a client provide a recipient when sending a paekli.
If you want to ensure that other clients can integrate as quickly as possible, even without the full feature set, make sure to keep these features <em>optional</em>.
In the case of the recipient, your HTTP server could default to some shared inbox where everyone can send and receive paekli without identification.</p>
<h2 id="expanding-our-storage-space-3"><a class="header" href="#expanding-our-storage-space-3">Expanding our storage space</a></h2>
<p>Requirements:</p>

<p>Now that you have an HTTP server, you can pretty much do whatever you want!
All clients can integrate with the HTTP server and thereby become connected.</p>
<p>The best way to integrate a client with the HTTP server is by implementing the <a href="http/../http_client.html">HTTP client</a> storage backend.
The only client component that cannot benefit from that is the web app, because it runs in the browser.
To integrate that one with the HTTP server, see <a href="http/../web_app_http.html">Web App and HTTP</a>.</p>
<p>The one thing the HTTP server cannot do is live-updating GUIs.
If you want that, you should implement the WebSocket component.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="websocket-server"><a class="header" href="#websocket-server">WebSocket Server</a></h1>
<div id="admonition-building-on-the-http-server" class="admonition admonish-warning" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-building-on-the-http-server-title">

<p>Building on the HTTP server</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="websocket.html#admonition-building-on-the-http-server"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>The WebSocket component can <em>technically</em> be implemented without the HTTP server, but it's not very useful and makes everything more complicated.</p>
<p>Therefore, this guide assumes you have completed the <a href="http.html">HTTP server</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>WebSocket is a protocol that allows us to easily send messages from the server to the client.
This is in contrast to HTTP, where we are limited to requests initiated by the client.
The most important use case for websockets is a live-updating GUI.
In our case, the server can let its clients know immediately when a new paekli is available.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-hello-world-of-websocket"><a class="header" href="#the-hello-world-of-websocket">The Hello World of WebSocket</a></h1>
<p>The websocket stuff will be built on top of the HTTP server, so we don't need a new package this time.
We're mostly going to work in <code>paekli-http</code>.</p>
<h2 id="axum-websocket-feature-flag"><a class="header" href="#axum-websocket-feature-flag">Axum WebSocket feature flag</a></h2>
<p>Axum has built-in support for websockets, but it is gated behind a feature flag.
Add it with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo add axum --features ws
</code></pre>
<h2 id="opening-a-websocket-connection"><a class="header" href="#opening-a-websocket-connection">Opening a WebSocket connection</a></h2>
<p>First of all, we'll need a new route where clients can request to open a websocket connection:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>axum::Router::new()
    // ...
    .route("/notifications", get(subscribe_to_notifications))
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Next, we actually have to write that handler.
Don't worry, everything will be explained in a second.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[axum::debug_handler]
async fn subscribe_to_notifications(ws: WebSocketUpgrade) -&gt; axum::response::Response {
    ws.on_upgrade(|mut socket| async {
        socket
            .send(axum::extract::ws::Message::Text("Hello, world!".into()))
            .await
            .unwrap();
        socket.close().await.unwrap();
    })
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>WebSocketUpgrade</code> is a type from axum, assuming the feature <code>ws</code> is enabled.
Axum will only call this handler with requests for websocket connections.</li>
<li>In the body, we immediately pass a closure to <code>ws.on_upgrade()</code>, which is run once the connection is successfully established.</li>
<li>Once we have the <code>socket</code> in the closure, we send a single message <code>"Hello, world!"</code> and close it again.</li>
<li>Don't worry about <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Websockets can be tricky to debug.
One option is to use <a href="https://github.com/vi/websocat">websocat</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">websocat ws://127.0.0.1:4200/notifications
</code></pre>
<div id="admonition-success" class="admonition admonish-success" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-success-title">
<div class="admonition-title">
<div id="admonition-success-title">
<p>Success</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="websocket/hello_world.html#admonition-success"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>This should print "Hello, world!" to the terminal.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="notifications"><a class="header" href="#notifications">Notifications</a></h1>
<p>Let's say we want to send a notifications to all of our subscribers once a new paekli was sent, i.e. it is ready to be received.</p>
<p>Now we've got a bit of a problem.
The two handler functions <code>send_paekli</code> and <code>subscribe_to_notifications</code> are completely separate!
They cannot talk to each other at all.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <code>axum</code> has a solution for this problem.
We can pass some "shared state" to all handlers.
In this case, the state is just going to be a channel through which the handlers can communicate with each other.
The channel itself is provided by the tokio runtime.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let (notification_sender, _) = tokio::sync::broadcast::channel(16);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The argument <code>16</code> is the channel capacity, it shouldn't matter for our purpose.
The second return value is a <em>receiver</em> from that channel, but we don't care about it for now.
We can always create new receivers by subscribing on the sender again.
Let's pass this channel as shared state to all handler functions:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>axum::Router::new()
    // ...
    .route()
    .with_state(notification_sender)
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>There will likely be some compile error now because a type cannot be inferred.
This should be fixed shortly.
Let's use this sender in the <code>send_paekli</code> handler:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>async fn send_paekli(
    State(sender): State&lt;Sender&lt;()&gt;&gt;,
    // other params...
) {
    // ...
    sender.send(()).unwrap();
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The necessary imports are <code>axum::extract::State</code> and <code>tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender</code>.
We specify the type of notification being sent as the empty tuple with <code>Sender&lt;()&gt;</code>.
This can be changed later, if we actually want to send information with the notification.</p>
<p>The semantics are simple, the <code>State</code> wrapper around our sender tells <code>axum</code> to pass in the shared state we gave to the router earlier.
Then we send an empty tuple over the channel to indicate a paekli was sent.</p>
<p>Now we can listen on this channel in the <code>subscribe_to_notifications</code> handler:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>async fn subscribe_to_notifications(
    ws: WebSocketUpgrade,
    State(sender): State&lt;Sender&lt;()&gt;&gt;,
) -&gt; axum::response::Response {
    // ...
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Within the function body, you'll have to make three modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>get a new receiver by calling <code>sender.subscribe()</code></li>
<li>loop over incoming notifications with <code>receiver.recv().await</code> (just send any string over websocket in the loop body)</li>
<li><code>move</code> the channel into the closure: <code>ws.on_upgrade(|mut socket| async move {</code> (otherwise you'll get a lifetime error)</li>
</ul>
<div id="admonition-success" class="admonition admonish-success" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-success-title">
<div class="admonition-title">
<div id="admonition-success-title">
<p>Success</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="websocket/notifications.html#admonition-success"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>At this point, you should be able to listen on mutliple websocket connections and get a notification every time a paekli is sent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is already enough in terms of the MVP.
Feel free to work on an integration next, like <a href="websocket/../web_app_websocket.html">Web App and WebSocket</a>.
That being said, there is one more section about handling individual recipients.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="individual-recipients-4"><a class="header" href="#individual-recipients-4">Individual Recipients</a></h1>
<p>We can now send and receive notifications anytime a paekli is sent.
However, our users probably only want to be notified if there is a paekli for a specific recipient, i.e. themselves.</p>
<p>Let's broadcast information about the recipient of the paekli in our <code>send_paekli</code> handler.
We'll need to change the type of our channel from <code>Sender&lt;()&gt;</code> to <code>Sender&lt;String&gt;</code>.
Then we just... <code>sender.send(recipient)</code> in the body.
You should already have access to this <code>recipient</code> if you implemented the additional feature of individual recipients for the HTTP server component.
We receive the notifications in the <code>subscribe_to_notifications</code> handler function, so we'll need to update the <code>Sender</code> type there as well to fix any compilation errors.</p>
<p>Now we could just pass along the name of the recipient from the internal channel to the websocket.
That would be simple and serve the purpose.
But it's a little nicer if the user can specify a recipient up front and only receive those notifications.</p>
<h2 id="the-recipient-as-path-parameter"><a class="header" href="#the-recipient-as-path-parameter">The recipient as path parameter</a></h2>
<p>In terms of our API, we'll allow users to subscribe to notifications on different URL <em>paths</em>.
For example, Alice can subscribe to her notifications at <code>/notifications/alice</code> and Bob can subscribe at <code>/notifications/bob</code>.</p>
<p>But we don't want to write a new handler function for ever possible recipient... that would be a lot.
Axum allows us to turn some segments of the path into parameters to the handler function.
To do that, we need to first declare the route with the new path:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>.route("/notifications/:recipient", get(subscribe_to_notifications))
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Notice the colon before <code>recipient</code>, it means this is a parameter instead of a literal part of the path.
Next, we can accept the parameter in our handler:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>async fn subscribe_to_notifications(
    Path(recipient): Path&lt;String&gt;,
    // ...
) -&gt; Response {
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>Path</code> is imported from <code>axum::extract::Path</code>.
This type tells the <code>axum</code> library to extract the value of <code>recipient</code> from the URL of the request.
That only works because we declared the parameter previously in the route declaration with <code>"/notifications/:recipient"</code>.</p>
<details id="admonition-more-than-one-path-parameter" class="admonition admonish-note" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-more-than-one-path-parameter-title">
<summary class="admonition-title">
<div id="admonition-more-than-one-path-parameter-title">
<p>More than one path parameter</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="websocket/individual_recipients.html#admonition-more-than-one-path-parameter"></a>
</summary>
<div>
<p>We only need one path parameter here, so there's not much that can go wrong.
But what if we had multiple path parameters?
For example: <code>"/notifications/:recipient/:sender"</code> to only get notified for paekli from a specific sender?</p>
<p>That works too, but then we have to accept the parameters as a <em>tuple</em> inside the <code>Path</code> wrapper from <code>axum</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>async fn subscribe_to_notifications(
    Path((recipient, sender)): Path&lt;(String, String)&gt;,
    // ...
) -&gt; Response {
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The names of the parameters <code>recipient</code> and <code>sender</code> don't really matter.
<code>axum</code> gives us the parameters in a tuple in the order they appear in the URL path.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>Inside the body of <code>subscribe_to_notifications</code>, we can now send a notification on the websocket only if the recipient matches the one of our URL parameter.
The code you'll need might look a little something like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let Ok(channel_recipient) = receiver.recv().await
if url_path_recipient == channel_recipient {
    socket.send(/**/)
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="trying-it-out"><a class="header" href="#trying-it-out">Trying it out</a></h2>
<p>With all these connections, it's becoming more tricky to test that everything works.
Here are a couple commands to get you started.
You might have to adjust some details, especially if you designed your HTTP API a little differently.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Terminal 1: run HTTP &amp; WebSocket server
cd paekli-http
cargo run
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Terminal 2: listen to notifications for Alice

# send paekli to Bob
curl --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{ "content": "shoes", "recipient": "alice" }' localhost:4200/paekli
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of using <code>curl</code> to send paekli, you can obviously also use any of you client components if you have already integrated them with the HTTP client storage backend.</p>

<p>Phew, that was a little tedious!
Hopefully everything worked out as expected.
🤞</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Obviously we don't want to handle websocket connections as manually as we did just now.

<h2 id="storing-paekli-1"><a class="header" href="#storing-paekli-1">Storing paekli</a></h2>
<p>Applications are expected to store their data in different locations depending on the operating system.
We might be tempted to tell our users to just install Linux when they're bugging us about supporting their platform.
Instead, let's use the <a href="https://docs.rs/directories">directories</a> crate to not have to worry about it at all.</p>
<p>Here's a couple lines of code you'll probably need:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let project_dir = directories::ProjectDirs::from("dev", "buenzli", "paekli")
    .expect("the user's home directory seems to be corrupt");

let storage_dir = project_dir.data_dir();

std::fs::create_dir_all(storage_dir).expect("failed to create storage directory");

std::fs::write(storage_dir.join("content"), content)
    .expect("failed to store paekli");
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>On Linux, a paekli will be stored at the following location:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">~/.local/share/paekli/content
</code></pre>
<h2 id="retrieving-paekli"><a class="header" href="#retrieving-paekli">Retrieving paekli</a></h2>
<p>Retrieving paekli should be easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the same file where the paekli is stored.</li>
<li>Handle the case when there's no paekli.</li>
<li>Delete any retrieved paekli so they don't get delivered twice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="error-handling"><a class="header" href="#error-handling">Error handling</a></h2>
<p>I will leave this up to you.
The CLI guide includes some additional instructions about using the <code>anyhow</code> crate for error handling.
Whatever you choose to do, it may impact the function signatures in your <code>DistributionCenter</code> trait.
That's totally fine, the compiler will help you with any necessary refactoring.</p>

<p>For this component, you need the <code>DistributionCenter</code> trait.
If you don't have it yet, do the <a href="storage_backend.html">Storage Backend</a> guide first and then come back here.</p>
<p>SQL databases are ubiquitous and the ability to use them is a marketable skill.
You don't need to know SQL to follow this guide, but the provided code snippets won't be explained either.
At the start of a new project, we have to ask ourselves which database to pick, like PostgreSQL, MySQL etc.
We also have to decide if and what library we are going to use to make queries from our general-purpose programming language.</p>
<p>If we wanted to pull out the big guns, we could go with PostgreSQL and a full-blown ORM like <a href="https://diesel.rs/">diesel</a>.
But for our purposes, we'll travel a little lighter with SQLite as our database and <a href="https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/">sqlx</a> as our query library.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-the-database"><a class="header" href="#connecting-to-the-database">Connecting to the database</a></h2>
<p>In <code>paekli-core</code>, create a new storage backend like you've probably done before:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct SqlDatabase;

impl DistributionCenter for SqlDatabase {
    // ...
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>sqlx</code> is database agnostic and provides <a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx?tab=readme-ov-file#sqlx-is-not-an-orm">compile-time checked queries</a> without abstracting the raw power of SQL away from you.
It is also fundamentally <code>async</code>, a language feature we did not discuss.
Luckily, <code>async</code> is not necessary to understand the rest of what's going on, so it won't be explained here either.</p>
<p>Let's add the dependency with the feature flags <code>sqlite</code> and <code>runtime-tokio</code>, which is necessary to run <code>async</code> code.
We'll need to use the runtime <code>tokio</code> directly as well, let's add it with the full feature set.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo add sqlx --features sqlite,runtime-tokio
cargo add tokio --features full
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast to the file system storage or the HTTP client, the SQL database needs some initialization code.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl SqlDatabase {
    fn new() -&gt; Self {
        // ...
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>To determine the location to store our database, we'll use the <code>directories</code> crate.
You've probably already done this for the CLI.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let project_dir = directories::ProjectDirs::from("dev", "buenzli", "paekli")
    .expect("the user's home directory seems to be corrupt");

let storage_dir = project_dir.data_dir();

std::fs::create_dir_all(storage_dir).expect("failed to create storage directory");

let db_path = storage_dir.join("db.sqlite");
if !db_path.exists() {
    std::fs::File::create(&amp;db_path).expect("failed to create database");
}
let db_url = format!("sqlite:{}", db_path.display());
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Next, we need to create a database connection pool.
The way to do that with <code>sqlx</code> is an <code>async</code> task, so we need a <code>tokio</code> runtime to execute it.
We'll also need the runtime to execute queries later, so we'll store it in a variable <code>rt</code>.</p>

<p>This is not really how you would do <code>async</code> programming in a serious project.

</summary>
<div>
<p>You're right, a connection pool doesn't really make sense in the context of SQLite.
However, to be database agnostic, <code>sqlx</code> uses the same abstractions for SQLite as for PostgreSQL etc.
We <em>could</em> create a single connection to SQLite, but then we'd need a mutable reference to it to execute queries.
Connection pools in <code>sqlx</code> have the additional convenience that queries can be executed on an immutable reference to them.</p>
</div>
</details>
<h2 id="initial-migrations"><a class="header" href="#initial-migrations">Initial migrations</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have an open database connection, we need to create the schema.</p>
<p><code>sqlx</code> has a built-in feature for migrations.
It allows you to store them as scripts in some directory and automatically execute all of them.
However, since we just need a single table, we'll keep it simple and use a regular query.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let create_table_task = sqlx::query(
    "
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS paekli (

    ",
)
.execute(&amp;pool);
rt.block_on(create_table_task).unwrap();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="storing-paekli-2"><a class="header" href="#storing-paekli-2">Storing paekli</a></h2>
<p>We can finally start implementing the functionality of <code>DistributionCenter</code>.
Here's the query to insert a paekli into the database.
This <code>async</code> task needs to be executed on the <code>tokio</code> runtime with <code>.block_on()</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>sqlx::query("INSERT INTO paekli VALUES (?)")
    .bind(content)
    .execute(&amp;pool)

</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="sql_database.html#admonition-prepared-queries"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>The <code>?</code> in the query string and <code>.bind(content)</code> are executed as a <em>prepared statement</em>.
Prepared statements have built-in protection against SQL injection (a common security vulnerability).</p>
<p>You should <strong>NEVER</strong> construct a SQL query from user input with normal string manipulation like the <code>format!()</code> macro.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="retrieving-paekli-1"><a class="header" href="#retrieving-paekli-1">Retrieving paekli</a></h2>
<p>A reasonable approach for retrieving paekli is a query like the following.
(<code>rowid</code> is automatically added to every table by SQLite.)</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let select_task = sqlx::query(
    "
    SELECT rowid, content FROM paekli
    LIMIT 1
    ",
)
.fetch_one(&amp;pool)
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This would work, but the returned values would be an SQL row, not the most convenient format.
Ideally, we want the result to be filled directly into a nice Rust type.
We can do that with <code>query_as</code> and a derived <code>FromRow</code> implementation on our own type:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct PaekliRow {
    rowid: i64,
    content: String,
}

let select_task = sqlx::query_as().fetch_one(&amp;pool);

let PaekliRow { rowid, content } = rt.block_on(select_task).unwrap();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Instead of calling <code>.unwrap()</code>, we should handle the case where no paekli exist.</p>
<p>Lastly, execute another query to delete the retrieved paekli from the database.
The SQL query to delete a row with a specific ID is: <code>DELETE FROM paekli WHERE rowid = ?</code>.</p>

<p>The implementation of <code>DistributionCenter</code> is complete.
Now you can extend your constructor function for <code>DistributionCenter</code> and enable your clients to select the new backend.</p>
<p>To enable all additional features for this storage backend, you might need a little more knowledge about SQL than what we've seen so far... good luck!</p>

<p>You don't need your own HTTP server for the HTTP client to work!
There is a reference implementation of the server which your client can talk to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Pretty much all of the available components can use an HTTP server to store paekli.
In order to avoid code duplication, we'll implement the <code>DistributionCenter</code> trait.
If you haven't created this trait yet, do the <a href="storage_backend.html">Storage Backend</a> guide first and then come back here.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

<h2 id="storing-paekli-3"><a class="header" href="#storing-paekli-3">Storing paekli</a></h2>
<p>The most common library for making HTTP requests is <code>reqwest</code> (nope, that's not a typo 😄).
Add it to your shared library <code>paekli-core</code> with a couple feature flags:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo add reqwest --features blocking,json
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a brief explanation for each feature flag.
They are appropriately mentioned in the documentation (<a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest">docs.rs/reqwest</a>), so you shouldn't have any issues picking the right ones if you use <code>reqwest</code> on your own.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>blocking</code><br />
<code>reqwest</code> is <code>async</code> by default, which is a language feature that we haven't discussed.
In order to use the simpler <em>blocking</em> API, we need to enable that flag.</li>
<li><code>json</code><br />
This one is intuitive, it enables JSON (de-)serialization via <code>serde_json</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, to create an HTTP request for storing a paekli, we're gonna need to create a <em>client</em> with <code>reqwest</code> and call its <code>post</code> method:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::new();
client
    .post("https://paekli.buenzli.dev/paekli")
    .json(todo!())
    .send()
    .unwrap();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>

<div>
<p>If you want to send the request to your own server, just replace the URL string with something like <code>http://localhost:4200/paekli</code> (make sure to get the right port).
If you want to get real fancy, try making the URL configurable in the <code>HttpClient</code>!
That way, users of this storage backend could use it to connect to any HTTP server they like.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>Notice that I left out the JSON body.
You have two options here:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you're using your own server, you should extract the types like <code>SendRequest</code> and <code>ReceiveResponse</code> into the shared library <code>paekli-core</code> so you can use them in the client as well.
That way you can ensure that client and server always agree on the structure of the data that's being sent.</li>
<li>If you're using the reference server, read its API documentation at <a href="https://paekli.buenzli.dev">paekli.buenzli.dev</a> to find out what structure of data it's expecting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, you should have some kind of struct which implements <code>serde::Serialize</code> which you can then pass into the <code>.json()</code> call.</p>
<h2 id="retrieving-paekli-2"><a class="header" href="#retrieving-paekli-2">Retrieving paekli</a></h2>
<p>To retrieve paekli, we need the <code>delete</code> method instead of <code>post</code>.
Obviously we also have to send a different request body, depending on what the server expects.</p>
<p>You may have discarded the response from the <code>store</code> operation, or you may have read it for error handling / reporting purposes.
Now, for the <code>retrieve</code> operation, we have to read the response to get the paekli content.
The response is what you get from the <code>.send().unwrap()</code>.
(you are encouraged to do better error handling than me 🙈)</p>
<p>Here's how to get the JSON response:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let data: ReceiveResponse = resp.json().unwrap();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Again, <code>ReceiveResponse</code> just has to be some type that implements <code>serde::Deserialize</code> and actually matches what we expect the server to respond.</p>
<h2 id="extending-the-constructor-function"><a class="header" href="#extending-the-constructor-function">Extending the constructor function</a></h2>
<p>The implementation of the <code>DistributionCenter</code> trait should be complete at this point, but we still need a way for <code>paekli-core</code> users to get their hands on an instance of <code>HttpClient</code>.
You will likely have to add some parameter to the constructor function, so users can select which storage backend they want.
As the number of backends grows, maybe an <code>enum</code> makes sense?
If some backends can even be configured further (e.g. server URL), such configuration data can be stored alongside the enum variant.
I'll leave the details up to you.</p>

<p>For multiple reasons, our different components may need to share some code.
Luckily this is very simple.
Let's start by initializing a new <em>library</em> package:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo new --lib paekli-core
</code></pre>
<p>This new library can be used in any of our other packages by adding it as a dependency first.
Note that we need the <code>--path</code> flag for a local library, as opposed to ones from crates.io.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd paekli-cli
cargo add --path ../paekli-core
</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, you can confirm it works by trying to import the generated <code>add</code> function.
Note how the dash in <code>paekli-core</code> changes to an underscore in Rust code.
This is automatic, because Rust identifiers cannot contain dashes.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// paekli-cli/src/main.rs
use paekli_core::add;

<p>As you implement more components, your shared library will accumulate its own dependencies.
Some of these dependencies are not compatible with the web app.
This can lead to <strong>difficult to understand error messages</strong>.
Essentially, the web app will fail to compile because a bunch of stuff was "not found".
This is because it doesn't exist in the browser, where our app will run.
The next section will explain how to deal with this.
If you have no intention of implementing the web app, you can safely ignore it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="target-specific-code-and-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#target-specific-code-and-dependencies">Target-specific code and dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Some functionality in <code>paekli-core</code> will only be available for components that run in a normal operating system.
This is notably not the case for the web app.</p>
<p>So, we need to be able to include or exclude some functionality of <code>paekli-core</code> based on which platform it's being compiled for.</p>
<h3 id="compiling-code-only-for-specific-targets"><a class="header" href="#compiling-code-only-for-specific-targets">Compiling code only for specific targets</a></h3>
<p>Let's assume your library is organized in two modules, <code>wasm_compatible</code> and <code>wasm_incompatible</code>.
In that case, you can skip compiling the incompatible module for wasm-builds like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>pub mod wasm_compatible;

#[cfg(not(target_family = "wasm"))]
pub mod wasm_incompatible;
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Depending on how you organize your code, you may have to add multiple of these annotations.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/attribute/cfg.html"><code>cfg</code> page of Rust By Example</a> and the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html">Rust Reference</a>.</p>
<h3 id="declaring-target-specific-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#declaring-target-specific-dependencies">Declaring target-specific dependencies</a></h3>
<p>Even if you already excluded your own target-incompatible code as explained above, dependencies declared in <code>Cargo.toml</code> will still (fail to) compile.
We need to tell cargo to completely exclude these libraries from the build, based on the target platform.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following example.
The dependency <code>serde</code> is compiled for every target, while <code>tokio</code> is not compiled for the web app.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># paekli-core/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0.197", features = ["derive"] }

[target.'cfg(not(target_family = "wasm"))'.dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.36.0", features = ["full"] }
</code></pre>
<p>Note how the <code>cfg</code> syntax is identical to the one used in the source code attribute.
The documentation for this is in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#platform-specific-dependencies">the cargo book</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="storage-backend"><a class="header" href="#storage-backend">Storage Backend</a></h1>
<p>Most of the components use identical methods to store paekli, but the method itself may be configurable.
For example, both the CLI and the python module might store paekli in the file system, an SQL database or delegate storage to the HTTP server.
The server itself may use the file system, a database <em>or</em> just keep it in-memory... you get the point.</p>
<p>This is the perfect place to introduce an abstraction.
We can program a component to work independently of how paekli are stored.
Different storage methods can then be swapped out easily.</p>
<p>If we think about a postal service, we might make the analogy of a distribution center.
The postal office doesn't need to know how the distribution center works, it only cares about the functionality it provides.</p>
<p>This is a perfect use case for a <code>trait</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait DistributionCenter {
    fn store();
    fn retrieve();
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The fundamental operations <code>store</code> and <code>retrieve</code> are obvious, but I'll let you decide what the parameters and return types should be.
Don't worry about getting it right immediately, you can always refactor the interface as the need arises.
Rust's strong type system will help you correctly change all the places where the interface is already used.</p>
<p>Since this <code>DistributionCenter</code> will be used by most of the components, it needs to go into our <code>paekli-core</code>.

<p>The first time you're reading this, you will only have one storage backend.
It would be simple to just use that directly.
To future proof for additional storage backends, let's assume we already have two:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// paekli-core/src/storage.rs
trait DistributionCenter {}

struct FileSystemStorage;
impl DistributionCenter for FileSystemStorage {}

struct HttpClient;
impl DistributionCenter for HttpClient {}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's try to write a simple function for creating a <code>DistributionCenter</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn new_distribution_center(local: bool) -&gt; ? {
    if local {
        FileSystemStorage
    } else {
        HttpClient
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Hm, this doesn't quite work.
There is no way for us to write a correct return type for this function, because the two possible values have different types.</p>
<p>What we need is <em>dynamic dispatch</em>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn new_distribution_center(local: bool) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn DistributionCenter&gt; {
    if local {
        Box::new(FileSystemStorage)
    } else {
        Box::new(HttpClient)
    }
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>

<p>How dynamic dispatch works</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="storage_backend.html#admonition-how-dynamic-dispatch-works"></a>
</summary>
<div>
<p>The full explanation of dynamic dispatch can be found in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html">chapter 17 of the Rust book</a>.
Here's a condensed version:</p>
<p>The <code>dyn</code> keyword generates a table of function pointers (<strong>vtable</strong>) for each type that implements a certain trait.
The vtable contains pointers to all methods of the trait and the <code>drop</code> method (destructor).</p>
<p>A pointer to this vtable is then stored <em>alongside</em> a pointer to the actual value.
Such a value is often referred to as a <em>trait object</em>.
It uses the same mechanism of storing metadata with a pointer (fat pointer) as the slice type.</p>
<p>This means that dynamic dispatch only works with some kind of pointer type, like <code>Box&lt;dyn Foo&gt;</code> or <code>&amp;dyn Foo</code>.
The <em>memory size</em> of the value behind the poiner is unknown at compile time.
That's OK though, because the only thing you can do with such a value is call methods on it that actually do know its size.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>Finally, in your clients that need to access a distribution center, you can write:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let center = new_distribution_center();
center.store();
center.retrieve();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="web-app-and-http"><a class="header" href="#web-app-and-http">Web App and HTTP</a></h1>
<p>The MVP of the web app stores paekli for delivery in a local signal.
This means the web app cannot send or receive paekli to and from other components.
Also, the paekli that were sent but not received are lost when the web app reloads.
(That could be fixed though without any integrations, browsers do allow websites to persist data.)</p>
<p>These limitations will be fixed by the integration with the HTTP server.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-request-types"><a class="header" href="#sharing-request-types">Sharing request types</a></h2>
<p>Our HTTP server expects requests from us to be in specific JSON formats.
Those formats are derived from our Rust types, so we didn't need to specify them explicitly.</p>
<p>Therefore, the easiest way to ensure we are always sending and receiving correctly-formatted JSON is to use the type system!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="shared_lib.html">Create a shared library</a> if you haven't already.</li>
<li>Copy the request types (<code>SendRequest</code>, <code>ReceiveResponse</code> etc.) from <code>paekli-http</code> to <code>paekli-core</code>.
You're free to organize it into a module or not.
All these types need to derive <code>Serialize</code> and <code>Deserialize</code>.</li>
<li>You might have to add some of the dependencies of <code>paekli-http</code> to <code>paekli-core</code>.
Don't forget to add all the <code>--features</code> you need.</li>
<li>Run <code>cargo add --path ../paekli-core</code> for the http and web app component to access the shared type.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sending-paekli"><a class="header" href="#sending-paekli">Sending paekli</a></h2>
<p>You probably have some signal to store sent paekli at this point.
We'll get rid of that signal and tell our HTTP server to store it instead.
We do that with the HTTP request which the server is programmed to accept.</p>
<p>We already had to add the dependency <code>gloo</code>, which is also going to help us send HTTP requests.
Let's start by defining the request:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use gloo::net::http::Request;

let request = Request::post("https://paekli.buenzli.dev/paekli")
    .json(&amp;SendRequest {
        content: todo!(),
        recipient: None,
        express: false,
    })
    .unwrap();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We use <code>Request::post</code> to say we want to send an HTTP request with the method <code>POST</code>.
We also pass the URL we want to send it to as the argument.
Notice the path <code>/paekli</code> at the end, it has to match the router configuration of the server.
You can replace the domain with <code>localhost:3000</code> or whatever port you have, if you want to talk to your own server.
You can even make the domain configurable in the UI, if you like!
But I leave that up to you, hard coding is perfectly fine for our purposes.</p>
<p>Notice the argument to the <code>.json()</code> method.
It's a reference to our <code>SendRequest</code> type!
This is possible, because it implements the <code>Serialize</code> trait, which we were able to derive.
We can be pretty confident the body of that request is exactly as the HTTP server expects it.
You just need to add the correct <code>content</code>.</p>
<p>We still have to actually send the request, here's how that goes:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>spawn_local(async {
    request.send().await.unwrap();
});
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>

</summary>
<div>
<p>There is quite a bit of unintuitive boilerplate here.
The reason is that browsers don't (yet) allow WebAssembly to make HTTP requests.
Rather, wasm has to ask JavaScript to do it instead.
Luckily, this glue code is generated by our libraries.</p>
<p>The browser only allows JavaScript to make HTTP requests via a browser API, which is <em>asynchronous</em> for performance reasons.
So these weird-looking three lines of code construct an asynchronous JavaScript task in WebAssembly and instruct JavaScript to process it via its own runtime.</p>
<p>Still confused?
Yeah, me too buddy.</p>

<p>You can test whether or not your send request worked by making a receive request via <code>curl</code>.</p>
<p>If you're using <a href="https://paekli.buenzli.dev">paekli.buenzli.dev</a>, you can also trigger a receive request in the API docs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="receive-paekli"><a class="header" href="#receive-paekli">Receive paekli</a></h2>
<p>The general idea here is the same as for sending paekli.</p>
<p>Firstly, you need to consider the correct <code>Request</code> to construct.
Method, path, body... make sure to get them right.</p>
<p>Secondly, when you send the request in the <code>async</code> block, you need to actually read the response from the server.
There is a method <code>.json()</code> on <code>gloo</code>'s <code>Response</code> type for this purpose.
It is generic, so the compiler might need some kind of hint that you want a <code>ReceiveResponse</code> as we've defined it.</p>
<p>Also note that it's not trivial to get the response <em>out</em> of the <code>async</code> block.
You can display an <code>alert</code> from the <code>async</code> block, which I recommend.
Otherwise, if you'd like a more sophisticated user experience, you can use a <em>signal</em> to store the received paekli.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="web-app-and-websocket"><a class="header" href="#web-app-and-websocket">Web App and WebSocket</a></h1>
<p>If you don't have the <a href="websocket.html">WebSocket</a> component yet, you can still integrate with the reference implementation.
This guide assumes you have the feature for individual recipients implemented, but it should work without it with a few adjustments.</p>
<p>Let's first think about how we want to handle the websocket connection on the client side.
When users first open the app, we don't want any websocket connection to be opened.
Users should then be able to select a recipient (presumably themselves) and open a websocket connection to receive the notifications for that recipient.
Users should also be able to stop receiving notifications, i.e. close the websocket connection.</p>
<p>The most idiomatic way to achieve such a life cycle for resources in our UI library <code>leptos</code> is to tie it to the life cycle of a UI component.
To open a websocket connection, we render the component.
To close the connection, we stop rendering the component.
Sounds complicated and abstract for now, but we'll get there one step at a time.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-custom-component"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-custom-component">Creating a custom component</a></h2>
<p>Until now, we only had a <code>main</code> function and all our declarative UI was in a single <code>view!</code> macro call.
That macro contained standard HTML elements.
<code>leptos</code> allows us to define our own components and use them as if they were HTML elements:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[component]
fn NotificationListener() -&gt; impl IntoView {
    view! {
        "Hello from a custom component!"
    }
}

fn main() {
    // ...

    mount_to_body(move || {
        view! {
            // ...
            &lt;NotificationListener/&gt;
        }
    })
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If you have <code>trunk serve</code> running, you should now see the text in the custom component in your app.</p>
<h2 id="rendering-conditionally"><a class="header" href="#rendering-conditionally">Rendering conditionally</a></h2>
<p>Thinking about our final goal again, we need to be able to render this component conditionally, based on whether a websocket connection should be open or not at any given moment.</p>
<p>Let's start simple and use a <em>signal</em> to store a boolean.
A button can then toggle the signal and cause our component to be rendered or not.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let (get_should_render, set_should_render) = create_signal(false);
let toggle_should_render = move |_| set_should_render.update(|prev| *prev = !*prev);
view! {
    &lt;button on:click=toggle_should_render&gt;
        toggle rendering
    &lt;/button&gt;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Great, now let's render our custom component only if the boolean signal is <code>true</code>.
We can totally use <code>if</code> expressions for this, but it actually gets quite ugly to nest such expressions inside a <code>view!</code> macro.
It's also easy to accidentally make the UI non-reactive that way.
(Nested expressions have to be <em>wrapped in closures</em> to stay reactive.)
<code>leptos</code> has a nice <code>Show</code> component to make conditional rendering readable and robust.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>view! {
    &lt;Show when=move || get_should_render.get()&gt;
        &lt;NotificationListener/&gt;
    &lt;/Show&gt;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The text of the custom component should now appear and disappear when you click the button.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-websocket-connection"><a class="header" href="#using-a-websocket-connection">Using a websocket connection</a></h2>
<p>Now we want to associate an open websocket connection to our custom component.
Implementing this completely ourselves would be quite complicated.
Luckily, the library <code>leptos-use</code> already did it for us!</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo add leptos-use
</code></pre>
<p>We can simply call the function <code>leptos_use::use_websocket</code> with the URL.
The return type is <code>UseWebsocketReturn</code>, which is a struct that we can <em>destructure</em> to only accept what we actually need and discard anything else.
This struct contains a bunch of things to control the websocket connection at a low level, but we only care about being able to read incoming messages.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let url = "ws://localhost:4200/notifications/alice";
let UseWebsocketReturn { message, .. } = leptos_use::use_websocket(url);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>What we now need to do is <em>create a side effect</em> that triggers every time we receive a notification.
The concept of a side effect is related to <code>leptos</code>' reactivity system, which we discuss in detail here.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>create_effect(move |_| {
    if let Some(message) = message.get() {
        gloo::dialogs::alert(&amp;message);
    }
});
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Suffice it to say, the closure passed to <code>create_effect</code> will rerun every time there is a new message coming in over the websocket connection.</p>
<p>You should now be able to observe that an alert is triggered in the browser if a paekli is sent to alice.</p>
<h2 id="making-the-recipient-configurable"><a class="header" href="#making-the-recipient-configurable">Making the recipient configurable</a></h2>
<p>This I will leave mostly up to you, except for one feature of <code>leptos</code> that we haven't seen so far.
You can pass arguments to custom components, also referred to as "attributes" from the HTML perspective.
When declaring the component, it looks like a regular parameter.
When you use the component, it works with the <code>key=value</code> syntax like a normal HTML element.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[component]
fn NotificationListener(recipient: String) -&gt; impl IntoView {}

view! {
    &lt;NotificationListener recipient=String::from("alice") /&gt;
}
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
